This project was built using:

- Nextjs + TS
- TailwindCSS + DaisyUI
- wagmi + Alchemy.

## What's next?

Currently it is not possible to connect with Biconomy (which is what we used for AA wallets). For more details regarding this issue look at our devfolio submission.

This is a PoC using Metamask to fetch real data but that doesn't communicate with our smart contracts

## Live

The project is currently deployed at https://swaps.es/
